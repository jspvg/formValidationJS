In this repository you will find one of the tasks that I have done while attending a JavaScript course during March od 2022. 
The repositories are uploaded in the sequence in which they were done during the course.
The purpose of putting these "mini-projects" on github is purely for documenting progress while studying JavaScript in a semi-formal way adter finishing University.
The first commit includes the "bones" of the "mini-project" given by the tutor, while the rest include my solution to the given task.
